C13,False,"To set the value of '/c' to 3 on IOTA I1 (pure), you would typically use a command or function to update the value. However, based on the observations you've provided, it seems that the current state of IOTA I1 is:

```json
{
  ""a"": 1,
  ""b"": 2
}
```

Since '/c' is not currently present in the data, you would first need to set it. After setting '/c' to 3, you would then retrieve the value of '/c'.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it conceptually:

1. **Set '/c' to 3**:
   - Update the IOTA I1 data to include '/c' with the value of 3.

2. **Get '/c'**:
   - Retrieve the value of '/c' from IOTA I1.

Assuming the operation is successful, the expected result after setting '/c' would be:

```json
{
  ""a"": 1,
  ""b"": 2,
  ""c"": 3
}
```

And when you get '/c', the output would be:

```json
{
  ""c"": 3
}
