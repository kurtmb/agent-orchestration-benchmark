C13,False,"To set the value of '/c' to 3 on IOTA I1 (pure) and then retrieve it, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Set the value**: Use a command or function to set the value of '/c' to 3 on the IOTA I1 instance.
2. **Get the value**: After setting the value, use a command or function to retrieve the value of '/c'.

Since the current observations show that the result is consistently returning `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`, it seems that the value of '/c' has not been set or updated yet.

Assuming you have the capability to set the value, you would execute a command similar to:

```python
set_IOTA('I1', '/c', 3)
```

Then, to retrieve the value of '/c', you would execute:

```python
value = get_IOTA('I1', '/c')
```

If the setting was successful, the expected output for the retrieval would be:

```python
{'c': 3}

   - SIGMA S1: `{'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}`
