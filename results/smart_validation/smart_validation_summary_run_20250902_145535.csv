1. **Set the value**: Use a command to set the value of '/c' to 3 on IOTA I1.
2. **Get the value**: After setting the value, use a command to retrieve the value of '/c'.

Since the current observation shows that the result is `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`, it seems that the value of '/c' has not been set yet. 

Assuming you have the capability to execute the set command, you would do something like this:

```python
# Set the value
SET_IOTA(key='I1', path='/c', value=3)

# Get the value
value = GET_IOTA(key='I1', path='/c')
```

After executing the above commands, you should be able to retrieve the value of '/c', which should now be 3.

2. Merge SIGMA S1 with SIGMA S2, overriding the values in SIGMA S1 with those from SIGMA S2.
3. Pick the keys `['y', 'meta']` from the merged result.
4. Stringify the final result.

Given the observations:
- SIGMA S1: `{'x': 1, 'y': 2}`
- SIGMA S2: `{'y': 9}`

After merging (overriding values from S2 into S1):
- Merged result: `{'x': 1, 'y': 9, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}`

Now, we will pick the keys `['y', 'meta']`:
- Result: `{'y': 9, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}`

Finally, we stringify the result:
