   - SIGMA S2: `{'y': 9}`

2. **Set '/meta/label' to title-case of ALPHA A2**:
   - ALPHA A2: `'john doe'` (which becomes `'John Doe'` in title case).

3. **Merge SIGMA S1 and S2 (override)**:
   - Merging means that if there are overlapping keys, the values from S2 will take precedence.
   - After merging, we will have: `{'x': 1, 'y': 9, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}`.

4. **Pick keys ['y', 'meta']**:
   - From the merged result, we will extract: `{'y': 9, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}`.

5. **Stringify the result**:
   - The final result will be: `""{'y': 9, 'meta': {'label': 'John Doe'}}""`.
