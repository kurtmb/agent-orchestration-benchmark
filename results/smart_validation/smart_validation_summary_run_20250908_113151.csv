Since the current observations show that the data structure contains keys 'a' and 'b', but not 'c', it seems that '/c' has not been set yet. 

Assuming you have the capability to set values in IOTA, you would execute a command similar to:

```plaintext
SET_IOTA(I1, '/c', 3)
```

Then, to retrieve the value of '/c', you would execute:

```plaintext
GET_IOTA(I1, '/c')

1. **Set `/meta/label` to title-case of ALPHA A2**: The title-case of ""john doe"" is ""John Doe"".
2. **Merge SIGMA S1 and SIGMA S2**: We will override the values in S1 with those from S2.
3. **Pick keys `['y', 'meta']`**: We will extract these keys from the merged result.
4. **Stringify the result**: Convert the final result into a string format.

### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **Title-case ALPHA A2**:
   - ALPHA A2 = ""john doe""
   - Title-case = ""John Doe""

2. **SIGMA S1**:
   ```json
   {
       ""x"": 1,
       ""y"": 2,
       ""meta"": {
           ""label"": ""original label""
       }
   }
   ```

3. **SIGMA S2**:
   ```json
   {
       ""y"": 9
   }
   ```

4. **Merge S1 and S2 (override)**:
   - The merged result will be:
   ```json
   {
       ""x"": 1,
       ""y"": 9,
       ""meta"": {
           ""label"": ""John Doe""
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Pick keys `['y', 'meta']`**:
   - Resulting object:
   ```json
   {
       ""y"": 9,
       ""meta"": {
           ""label"": ""John Doe""
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Stringify the result**:
   - Final stringified result:
   ```json
   '{""y"":9,""meta"":{""label"":""John Doe""}}'
   ```
