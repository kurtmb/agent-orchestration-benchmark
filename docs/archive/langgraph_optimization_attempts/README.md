# LangGraph Optimization Attempts Archive

This directory contains all the experimental LangGraph optimization attempts that were tested during our comprehensive optimization effort.

## Archive Contents

### Adapters (`adapters/`)
- **`langgraph_optimized.py`** - Complex routing with tool bucketing (Failed - import issues)
- **`langgraph_optimized_simple.py`** - Simplified approach (64.0% success rate)
- **`langgraph_optimized_v2.py`** - Intent classification and tool scoping (20.0% success rate)
- **`langgraph_optimized_v3.py`** - Refined tool scoping with multi-category selection (56.0% success rate)
- **`langgraph_enhanced.py`** - Domain routing with complex state management (0.0% success rate)

### Scripts (`scripts/`)
- **Test Scripts**: `test_langgraph_*.py` - Test scripts for each optimization attempt
- **Benchmark Runners**: `run_benchmark_langgraph_*.py` - Benchmark execution scripts
- **Analysis Tools**: `analyze_failures.py`, `analyze_v3_failures.py` - Failure analysis utilities

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- **`LANGGRAPH_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`** - Initial performance analysis
- **`LANGGRAPH_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`** - Technical debugging guide
- **`LANGGRAPH_V4_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`** - V4 optimization strategy
- **`TOOL_TRACKING_FIX_PLAN.md`** - Tool tracking improvement plan

## Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Tool Result Extraction**: Properly extracting results from `{"result": value}` format
2. **Enhanced Prompts**: Better system prompts with clear instructions
3. **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and timeout protection
4. **Simplified Approaches**: Less complex architectures often performed better

### What Didn't Work
1. **Tool Scoping**: Reducing available tools often hurt performance
2. **Intent Classification**: Added complexity without clear benefits
3. **Complex Routing**: Could prevent tool execution
4. **Planning Steps**: Could interfere with tool calling

## Current Active Implementations

The following implementations are currently active and available in the main codebase:

- **`langgraph_improved.py`** - Best fair implementation (66.0% success rate)
- **`langgraph_react_enhanced.py`** - Alternative ReAct approach (66.0% success rate)

## How to Use This Archive

### To Revisit an Approach
1. Copy the desired adapter from `adapters/` to `agentbench/core/adapters/`
2. Copy the corresponding test script from `scripts/` to the root directory
3. Copy the benchmark runner from `scripts/` to the root directory
4. Run tests to verify functionality

### To Understand the Evolution
1. Read the documentation in `docs/` in chronological order
2. Compare different adapter implementations
3. Review the analysis scripts to understand failure patterns

### To Build on Previous Work
1. Start with `langgraph_improved.py` as the best fair implementation
2. Consider the lessons learned from failed attempts
3. Focus on high-impact improvements identified in the summary
